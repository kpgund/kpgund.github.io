\protect\hypertarget{research-interests}{}
I am interested in bridging basic and applied wildlife sciences to help
managers make informed decisions on wildlife of interest with limited
knowledge or data. For my PhD research, I am continuing my workw ith the
Buderman Lab and establishing new partnerships within the Pennsylvania
Game Commission. I will be working with the PGC to detect changes in
low-density and elusive species of greatest conservation need in
Pennsylvania. This work will focus on Barn owls, bats, and marsh birds,
oh my!
