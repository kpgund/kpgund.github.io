### Research interests
I am interested in bridging basic and applied wildlife sciences to help managers make informed decisions on wildlife of interest with limited knowledge or data.
For my PhD research, I am continuing my workw ith the Buderman Lab and establishing new partnerships within the Pennsylvania Game Commission. I will be working with the PGC to detect changes in low-density and elusive species of greatest conservation need in Pennsylvania. This work will focus on Barn owls, bats, and marsh birds, oh my!
